# Apple Health & Google Fit Demo

## About this app:

This is a health and fitness tracking application that allows you to view, add, modify, and remove your health and fitness records. It seamlessly synchronizes your data with Apple Health for iOS users and Google Fit for Android users.

When you make changes to your health or fitness data within this app, it will automatically update and sync with either Apple Health or Google Fit, depending on your device.

Conversely, if you make alterations to your health or fitness data using the Apple Health or Google Fit apps, this app will automatically receive and synchronize those changes.

You can access information on your active energy expenditure, basal energy expenditure, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen levels, step count, and more. Additionally, you can monitor your body temperature, heart rate, sleep patterns, and other metrics, but this requires the use of an Apple iWatch or an Android smartwatch.
